=head1 NAME

Net::Stomp::Receipt - An extension to Net::Stomp (STOMP client) to allow transactional sends.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Net::Stomp::Receipt;

  my $stomp = Net::Stomp::Receipt->new({
    hostname   => 'localhost',
    port       => '61613',
    PERSISTENT => 1,
  });

  $stomp->connect({
    login    => 'hello',
    passcode => 'there'
  });

  $stomp->send_safe({
    destination => '/queue/foo',
    body => 'test message'
  }) or die "Couldn't send the message!";


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is an extension to Net::Stomp module, an Streaming
Text Orientated Messaging Protocol client, that adds a new
method send_safe which uses "transactional sends".

By this way, any message sent to the stomp server is identified
with a transaction id, that must be acked by a server receipt.
In case of failure, the send is aborted.
